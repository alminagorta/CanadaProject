Two main sources of Biomonitoring data: 

# CABIN: Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network

CABIN is an aquatic monitoring program for assessing the health of fresh water ecosystems in Canada. Benthic macroinvertebrates,habitat features,water quality
parameters are collected in the 11 major drainage areas in Canada. This data is used as an indicator of the health of that water body.
Here the St. Lawrence Drainage Area is presented as example of the data available and data analysis. You can download the other drainage areas from [CABIN]

# OBBN: Ontario Benthos Biomonitoring Network

"This contains biological, chemical, and habitat data for streams and lakes sampled between 2007 and 2013.

Information includes:

benthic-invertebrate taxa-counts
habitat
water chemistry
sampling locations
information describing records e.g., sampling agencies, taxonomists, collection dates, waterbody types"
